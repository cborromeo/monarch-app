<p>
  Unlike some ontology browsers, which give a direct topological
  view of the graph relations of terms, this browser shows the
  logical relations of the term in question to its ancestors and
  children.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if you were to select the term "neurogenesis"
  (GO:0022008), you would see the current term in question with a
  yellow triangle next to it. The current term's ancestors back to
  the root would be arrayed above, with their relationship to the
  current term next to it (e.g. "neurogenesis" is "part_of"
  "developmental process"). Below the current term is the current
  terms children, with a similar relationship next to them.
</p>
<p>
  You may switch the top-level ontology by clicking one of the
  top-level term buttons, or you may jump directly to a term by
  typing some identifying text into the input field and selecting
  the term from the dropdown.
